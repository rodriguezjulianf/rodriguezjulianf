I'm interested in working on projects where i have the possibility to learn as a developer and as a person too.
I like developing and making the final product efficient by optimizing it.
I enjoy refactoring code and learning new libraries and technologies.

Skills: REACT, REDUX, RXJS, POSTGRESQL, NODE, SEQUELIZE, EXPRESS, TYPESCRIPT, FIREBASE, HTML, CSS
